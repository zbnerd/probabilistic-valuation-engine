## Key Findings

### Strengths

| Strength | Evidence | Impact |
|----------|----------|--------|
| **Architecture** | 96% CLAUDE.md compliance | Zero architectural drift |
| **Security** | 100% auth/auth coverage | Production-ready |
| **Resilience** | Circuit breaker + locks | Fault tolerant |
| **Observability** | Micrometer + Prometheus | Full visibility |

### Gaps (Non-blocking)

| Gap | Impact | Timeline |
|-----|--------|----------|
| Phase 7 (#283, #282, #126) | Scale-out prerequisites | Planned |

- Set up operational dashboards

**Phase 7** (Sprint 1-3):
- Execute #283 (Stateful removal)
- Execute #282 (Multi-module)
- Execute #126 (CQRS)
