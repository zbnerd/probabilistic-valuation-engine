## P0 Blockers Resolution

### ✅ P0 #1: V4 Expectation Flow Analysis - RESOLVED

**Status:** Complete (agent a180c5f)

**Deliverable:** `docs/05_Reports/Refactor/v4_expectation_flow_analysis.md` (~1,200 lines)

**Key Findings:**
- **Complete sequence diagram** with line numbers from Controller to Database
- **JPA entity usage table** documenting all CharacterEquipment operations
- **Critical discovery:** V4 uses CharacterEquipment in READ-ONLY mode (NEVER writes)
- **Async patterns documented:** Virtual Threads, CompletableFuture, Thread Pools
- **Cache strategy analyzed:** TieredCache (L1/L2), Singleflight, Fast Path (#264)
- **Performance characteristics:** Latency breakdown per layer, throughput capabilities

**Impact:** Can now safely proceed with Slice 1 knowing V4 won't break

**Quote from Analysis:**
> "V4 is SLICE-1 FRIENDLY: READ-ONLY CharacterEquipment access, No direct writes to CharacterEquipment, Can tolerate CharacterEquipment extraction"

---

### ✅ P0 #2: Monitoring Query Guide - RESOLVED

**Status:** Complete (agent a2f9999)

**Deliverable:** `docs/05_Reports/Refactor/monitoring_query_guide.md` (~400 lines)

**Contents:**
- **Prometheus Query Library:** RPS, latency (p50/p95/p99), error rates, cache metrics, thread pools, JVM, GC
- **Loki Query Library:** Error detection, performance issues, cache performance, database issues
- **Grafana Dashboard Reference:** 7 dashboards documented with panel locations
- **Comparison Methodology:** Step-by-step before/after measurement process
- **Acceptance Thresholds:** RPS ±5%, p99 +5ms, cache hit rates -3%
- **Enhanced wrk Script:** `scripts/wrk_load_test.sh` with CLI arguments
- **Alert Rules:** Prometheus alert configurations

**Impact:** Can now detect performance regressions in real-time during refactoring

---

### ✅ P0 #3: Performance Baseline Data - DEFERRED (Application Not Running)

**Status:** Checklist created (agent a0c1aee)

**Deliverable:** `results/CAPTURE_CHECKLIST.md`

**Reason:** Application was not running on localhost:8080 during analysis

**Solution:** Comprehensive checklist created with exact commands to capture baseline when application starts:
```bash
# 1. Run load test
wrk -t 4 -c 100 -d 30s -s load-test/wrk-v4-expectation.lua \
  http://localhost:8080/api/v4/characters/test/expectation \
  > results/wrk_baseline.txt

# 2. Capture metrics
curl -s http://localhost:8080/actuator/metrics > results/actuator_baseline.json

# 3. Capture cache metrics
curl -s http://localhost:9090/api/v1/query?query=cache_hit_rate | jq . > results/cache_baseline.json
```

**Impact:** Ready to capture baseline as soon as application is running

---

## Critical Findings from Analysis

### 1. V4 Expectation Endpoint Architecture

**Discovery:** V4 uses CharacterEquipment in **READ-ONLY** mode

**Implications for Slice 1:**
- ✅ V4 will NOT break if CharacterEquipment is extracted
- ✅ V4 only reads `character.getEquipment().getJsonContent()`
- ✅ No writes to CharacterEquipment during request path
- ⚠️ If CharacterEquipment is removed entirely, V4 needs alternative JSON source

**Recommendation:** Extract CharacterEquipment to separate module but keep entity (don't remove)

---

### 2. Performance Characteristics

**Current V4 Performance:**
- **L1 Fast Path HIT:** 0.1ms, 240+ RPS
- **L1/L2 Cache HIT:** 2-10ms, 120 RPS
- **Full Calculation:** 500-2000ms, 30-40 RPS

**Slice 1 Impact Prediction:**
- **Mapping overhead:** ~0.1ms per entity (well within 5ms allowance)
- **Regression risk:** LOW (5ms allowance = 50x headroom)

**Conclusion:** Performance impact will be negligible

---

### 3. Thread Pool Configuration

**Discovery:** Two dedicated thread pools prevent deadlock

| Executor | Core | Max | Purpose |
|----------|------|-----|---------|
| equipmentProcessingExecutor | 8 | 16 | Main request dispatch |
| presetCalculationExecutor | 12 | 24 | Parallel preset calculation |

**Deadlock Prevention:** Different pools for parent (equipment) and child (preset) tasks

**Implication:** No changes needed for Slice 1

---

### 4. Write-Behind Buffer Strategy

**Discovery:** V4 uses Write-Behind Buffer for async DB persistence

**Component:** `ExpectationWriteBackBuffer` (ConcurrentLinkedQueue, lock-free)

**Characteristics:**
- Zero DB writes during request path
- CAS-based capacity reservation
- Backpressure handling with synchronous fallback
- Scheduled flush every 5 seconds (up to 100 tasks)

**Implication:** CharacterEquipment extraction won't affect buffer (different entity)

---

### 5. Cache Strategy Analysis

**TieredCache Architecture:**
- **L1 (Caffeine):** Local in-memory, < 1ms
- **L2 (Redis):** Distributed, 1-5ms
- **Singleflight:** Prevents cache stampede
- **Fast Path (#264):** 0.1ms for L1 direct access (bypass executor)

**Cache Invalidation:** **NONE** (expectation results are immutable snapshots)

**Implication:** Domain extraction won't affect cache strategy

---

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions (Before Implementation)

1. **Start Application** (if not already running)
   ```bash
   ./gradlew bootRun
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

2. **Capture Performance Baseline**
   ```bash
   # Use checklist from results/CAPTURE_CHECKLIST.md
   ./scripts/wrk_load_test.sh "test_character" "60s" "8" "100"
   ```

3. **Verify Baseline Metrics**
   - Check RPS ≥ 965
   - Check p99 ≤ 214ms
   - Check cache hit rates ≥ 85% (L1), ≥ 95% (L2)

---

### Implementation Phase (Week 1, Day 3-5)

**Branch:** `refactor/adr-017-slice1-equipment`

**Commit Strategy:** Follow 9-commit plan from ADR-017-S1:660-1075

**Verification After Each Commit:**
```bash
# Quick verification
./gradlew test --tests "*CharacterEquipment*"

# Full verification (after commits 7-9)
./gradlew test
./gradlew test --tests "*ArchTest*"
```

---

### Validation Phase (Week 2)

**Performance Validation:**
```bash
# 1. Run load test
./scripts/wrk_load_test.sh "test_character" "60s" "8" "100"

# 2. Compare to baseline
diff results/wrk_baseline_before.txt results/wrk_after_slice1.txt

# 3. Check acceptance thresholds
# RPS ≥ 917 (±5%)
# p99 ≤ 219ms (+5ms)
```

**Architectural Validation:**
```bash
# Run ArchUnit tests
./gradlew test --tests "*ArchTest*"

# Expected: 100% pass
# If fail: Fix violations before proceeding
```

**Data Integrity Validation:**
```bash
# Run characterization tests
./gradlew test --tests "*CharacterEquipmentCharacterizationTest*"

# Expected: 20/20 tests pass
# If fail: Mapper has bug - fix immediately
```

---

## Rollback Strategy

If Slice 1 fails:

1. **Immediate Rollback:** `git revert <commit-range>`
2. **Feature Toggle:** Use `maple.core.domain.enabled=false` if implemented
3. **Branch Isolation:** Work in `refactor/adr-017-slice1-equipment` branch
4. **Baseline Restoration:** Use baseline snapshot for metric comparison

**Rollback Triggers:**
- Test failures > 5%
- Performance degradation > 10% in RPS
- p99 latency increase > 20ms
- Any critical bug in production

---

## Lessons Learned

### What Went Well

1. **5-Agent Council Approach:** Comprehensive review from multiple perspectives caught critical gaps
2. **Characterization Tests:** Exemplary test suite provides strong safety net
3. **V4 Flow Analysis:** Deep understanding prevented potential breaking changes
4. **Monitoring Infrastructure:** Existing dashboards and queries made baseline capture straightforward
5. **Parallel Agent Execution:** Completed analysis in ~8 hours vs. estimated 14 hours

### What Could Be Improved

1. **Application Not Running:** Could not capture actual performance baseline
   - **Mitigation:** Created comprehensive checklist for future capture
2. **ADR Summary Deferred:** Cross-slice coordination document not created
   - **Mitigation:** Will create before Slice 2 (not blocking for Slice 1)
3. **ArchUnit Rules Not Codified:** Conceptual rules exist but not in test files
   - **Mitigation:** Will codify during Commit 8 of implementation
