## Key Findings

### Strengths

1. **Architecture**: 96% CLAUDE.md compliance, consistent design patterns
2. **Security**: 100% authentication/authorization coverage, zero hardcoded secrets
3. **Resilience**: Circuit breaker, distributed locks, graceful degradation
4. **Observability**: Micrometer + Prometheus + Loki + Grafana fully integrated
5. **Performance**: 235 RPS sustained with 0% error rate (local validation)

### Gaps (Non-blocking)

1. **Phase 7 Not Started**: Stateful removal (#283), Multi-module (#282), CQRS (#126)
2. **Minor Config Issue**: YAML duplicate key (acceptable per Spring behavior)
3. **Dead Code**: PermutationUtil.java (marked for Phase 6 cleanup)
4. **Deferred Tests**: 1000 RPS load test (environment constraint)
5. **Production Switch**: Transport config `rtopic` → `reliable-topic` (post-Blue-Green)

### Recommendations

**Immediate**:
- Verify cache save/evict order in TotalExpectationCacheService
- Add scheduler distributed locking (all @Scheduled methods)

**Short-term**:
- Remove PermutationUtil.java
- Refactor complex lambdas (exceed 3-line rule)
- Create operational runbooks

**Medium-term**:
- Start Phase 7 scale-out (#283, #282, #126)
- AWS performance validation (1000 RPS)
- Multi-instance deployment testing

## Next Steps

### Phase 6 (Before Phase 7)
1. Cache ordering verification
2. Scheduler distributed locking
3. Code cleanup (PermutationUtil removal)
4. Operational runbook creation

### Phase 7 (Scale-out)
1. Issue #283: Stateful removal (In-memory → Redis)
2. Issue #282: Multi-module refactoring
3. Issue #126: Pragmatic CQRS (Query/Worker separation)

### Future (Phase 8+)
