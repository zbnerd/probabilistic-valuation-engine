### 1.4 Check Phase (Gap Analysis)

**Analysis Date**: 2026-01-31

#### Gap Analysis Methodology

Two independent agents conducted comprehensive analysis:

**Agent a272af5 (Code Verification)**:
- Inspected source code for CLAUDE.md compliance
- Verified Zero Try-Catch policy (0 violations in service layer)
- Checked YAML configuration for consistency
- Result: **97% Match Rate** (14 PASS, 1 WARNING)

**Agent a31def4 (Plan-to-Code Mapping)**:
- Cross-referenced 62 plan files with implementation
- Analyzed architecture decisions and trade-offs
- Identified gaps and missing items
- Result: **91% Match Rate** (20 of 62 files analyzed in detail)

#### Consolidated Gap Analysis Results

**Overall Match Rate**: **91%** (PASS threshold: 90%)

**Gaps Identified** (Minor, do not block deployment):

1. **Phase 7 Not Started** (Planned):
   - Issue #283 (Stateful removal): No implementation yet (Design only)
   - Issue #282 (Multi-module): No implementation yet (Design only)
   - Issue #126 (Pragmatic CQRS): No implementation yet (Design only)

2. **Config Issues**:
   - YAML duplicate key bug: `application.yml` has `app:` block appearing 2x (Low priority)

   - Load test validation: 1000 RPS not yet verified (environment constraint)

**Impact Analysis**: All gaps are either intentional (Phase 7 design-only), minor (YAML duplication), or environmental (load test). None block production deployment.

## 6. Lessons Learned & Retrospective

### 6.1 What Went Well (Keep)

1. **Detailed Planning Phase**:
   - 62 plan documents provided comprehensive coverage
   - Plan-to-implementation traceability excellent (91% match)
   - Risk identification and mitigation strategies effective

2. **Architecture-First Approach**:
   - CLAUDE.md guidelines prevented architectural drift
   - Design patterns consistently applied across 60+ files
   - ADRs documented key decisions (ADR-003~009)

3. **Resilience by Default**:
   - LogicExecutor adoption prevented error handling antipatterns
   - CircuitBreaker, Retry, Timeout properly layered
   - Graceful Degradation present in critical paths

4. **Observability Integration**:
   - Micrometer metrics embedded in all major components
   - Prometheus + Loki + Grafana stack operational
   - Alert thresholds defined (Red Agent specifications)

5. **Externalized Configuration**:
   - YAML-based properties enable runtime tuning
   - Environment-specific profiles (dev, test, prod) working
   - No hardcoded values in critical components

### 6.2 What Needs Improvement (Problem)

1. **Phase 7 Scale-out Readiness**:
   - Stateful components (#283) not yet distributed
   - Multi-module architecture (#282) still in design phase
   - CQRS separation (#126) deferred to Phase 7
   - **Lesson**: Should have started Phase 7 earlier

2. **Load Test Validation**:
   - 1000 RPS validation not completed (target) → 235 RPS achieved (local)
   - Environment constraints prevented full stress testing
   - **Lesson**: Need dedicated AWS staging environment for performance validation

3. **Configuration Management**:
   - YAML duplicate key issue (minor but detectable)
   - Missing validation for some environment variables
   - **Lesson**: Pre-deployment YAML linting would catch issues

4. **Code Cleanup Discipline**:
   - PermutationUtil still present (marked for deletion)
   - Some complex lambda expressions exceed 3-line rule
   - **Lesson**: Establish automated code quality gates

5. **Documentation Gaps**:
   - Runbook for deployment procedures missing
   - Transport switch (RTopic → RReliableTopic) needs detailed guide
   - **Lesson**: Operational playbooks essential for distributed systems

### 6.3 What to Try Next (Try)

1. **Earlier Scale-out Planning**:
   - Start Phase 7 (#283, #282, #126) immediately
   - Parallel execution if resources available
   - Target completion in Q2 2026

2. **Automated Performance Testing**:
   - Set up continuous load testing in CI/CD pipeline
   - AWS spot instances for cost-effective stress testing
   - Auto-scaling validation

3. **Pre-deployment Quality Checks**:
   - YAML linting (checkstyle for YAML)
   - Automated Javadoc coverage scanning
   - Dead code detection (SpotBugs, IntelliJ analysis)

4. **Enhanced Observability**:
   - Distributed tracing (Jaeger/Zipkin integration)
   - Custom business metrics (domain-specific KPIs)
   - Synthetic monitoring for key flows

5. **Documentation Automation**:
   - Generate ADRs from architectural decisions
   - Auto-create runbooks from code comments
   - Changelog auto-generation from commits

## 7. Next Steps & Phase 7 Roadmap

### 7.1 Immediate Actions (Next 2 weeks)

**P0 Pre-Production**:
- [ ] Verify G6 YAML duplicate key handling (Spring config merge)
- [ ] Review G10, G11 cache save/evict order in TotalExpectationCacheService
- [ ] Add deprecation annotation to PermutationUtil.java
- [ ] Document transport switch procedure for Issue #278

**P1 Deployment Preparation**:
- [ ] Set up monitoring dashboards for executor metrics
- [ ] Configure Prometheus alert rules (Red Agent thresholds)
- [ ] Create deployment runbook for Issue #284, #278
- [ ] Test graceful shutdown with new executor config

### 7.2 Short-term Actions (Phase 6, 2-4 weeks)

**Code Quality**:
- [ ] Remove PermutationUtil.java (mark as deprecated first)
- [ ] Refactor complex lambdas exceeding 3-line rule (15+ occurrences)
- [ ] Complete cache ordering verification (G10, G11)
- [ ] Add scheduler distributed locking (P0-7, P0-8)

**Operations**:
- [ ] Switch Issue #278 transport to `reliable-topic` post-Blue-Green
- [ ] Set up multi-instance validation environment (2+ instances)
- [ ] Create operational runbooks for new features
- [ ] Train operations team on new metrics/alerts

### 7.3 Medium-term Actions (Phase 7, Sprint 1-3)

#### Phase 7 Step 1: Stateful Removal (#283)

**Sprint 1**: Feature Flag cleanup
- [ ] Set `redis.enabled` default to `true`
- [ ] Remove legacy in-memory fallbacks
- [ ] Verify P0/P1 components working with Redis

**Sprint 2**: In-Memory → Redis Migration
- [ ] AlertThrottler: Move to Redis set
- [ ] SingleFlight state: Move to Redis latch
- [ ] Shutdown flags: Move to Redis key
- [ ] Test concurrent instance updates

**Sprint 3**: Scheduler Distribution
- [ ] Add distributed locking to all @Scheduled methods
- [ ] Implement leader election or round-robin task distribution
- [ ] Validate 2+ instances, 0 duplicate processing

#### Phase 7 Step 2: Multi-Module Refactoring (#282)

- [ ] Create maple-common module (errors, responses, utilities)
- [ ] Create maple-core module (executors, locks, caches, infrastructure)
- [ ] Create maple-domain module (entities, repositories)
- [ ] Refactor maple-app to use multi-module imports
- [ ] Verify zero circular dependencies

#### Phase 7 Step 3: Pragmatic CQRS (#126)

- [ ] Create maple-api (Query Server): Lightweight read paths
- [ ] Create maple-worker (Worker Server): Heavy compute paths
- [ ] Implement message broker (Kafka/RabbitMQ)
- [ ] Test independent scaling of query vs. worker

### 7.4 Long-term Vision (Phase 8+)

**Scale-out Validation**:
- [ ] Multi-region deployment across AWS AZs
- [ ] 10,000+ concurrent users load test
- [ ] Chaos engineering validation (N01-N18 scenarios)
- [ ] Production hardening and observability tuning

**Technology Evolution**:
- [ ] Virtual Threads migration (Java 21+)
- [ ] Project Loom async I/O adoption
- [ ] Reactive Streams framework evaluation
- [ ] Event sourcing for audit trail
