## Detailed Findings by Agent

### BLUE AGENT - Architecture & SOLID Compliance

**Verdict:** CONDITIONAL PASS ⚠️

**Strengths:**
- ✅ SOLID principles: PASS (all 5 principles)
- ✅ DIP resolution clearly defined
- ✅ Clean architecture layering well-designed
- ✅ 9-commit migration plan is low-risk

**Critical Issues:**

1. **[C1] Missing V4 Expectation Flow Analysis - BLOCKER**
   - V4 is the primary consumer of `CharacterEquipment` (80%+ usage)
   - V4 has complex async patterns (virtual threads, buffering)
   - Without understanding call flow, domain extraction risks:
     - Missing use cases
     - Breaking V4 performance (965 RPS, p99 214ms)
     - Incomplete entity relationships
   - **Required before Slice 1 execution**

2. **[C2] Missing ADR Summary - COORDINATION GAP**
   - No cross-slice dependency mapping
   - Risk of duplicate Value Object definitions
   - No coordinated migration timeline
   - **Required before Slice 2 execution**

**Recommendations:**
- Create V4 flow analysis first (Option B - do it right the first time)
- Estimate 10-14 hours total for all missing analysis work
- Follow Week 1-2 timeline from recommendations

3. Bean Validation (@Valid, @NotBlank, @Pattern)
4. Circuit breaker markers (proper exception classification)
5. Exception chaining (cause preservation)
6. Structured logging (TaskContext)
7. Input sanitization (pattern validation)

**Overall Security Posture:** STRONG - No critical vulnerabilities

---

### RED AGENT - Performance & Regression Risk

**Verdict:** CONDITIONAL PASS ⚠️

**Performance Baseline Status:** ⚠️ INCOMPLETE
- ✅ Test execution time: PASS (~3 minutes, 33/35 tests passed)
- ✅ p99 threshold defined: PASS (≤219ms, +5ms allowance)
- ❌ RPS baseline: NOT MEASURED (load test script exists but not executed)
- ❌ Cache metrics: NOT CAPTURED
- ❌ JMH benchmarks: NOT RUN

**Regression Risk Assessment:** LOW (after fixes)
- ✅ Mapping overhead: PASS (~0.1ms per entity, within 5ms budget)
- ✅ DB impact: PASS (zero schema/query changes)
- ✅ Cache coherence: PASS (TieredCache handles this)
- ⚠️ Monitoring infrastructure: INCOMPLETE (no queries documented)

**Critical Issues:**

1. **Missing Performance Baseline Data (P0)**
   - RPS and p99 not measured in baseline
   - Must capture before Slice 1:
     - Run wrk load test
     - Run JMH benchmarks
     - Capture cache hit rates

2. **Missing Monitoring Query Guide (P0)**
   - No Prometheus/Loki queries documented
   - Blocks real-time regression detection
   - Required queries:
     - RPS monitoring
     - p99 latency tracking
     - Cache hit rates
     - Mapping overhead metrics
     - Error rate by layer

3. **Missing V4 Flow Analysis (P1)**
   - Critical for understanding performance impact
   - Need sequence diagrams and critical path analysis

**Performance Allowance Analysis:**
- 5ms p99 allowance provides 50x headroom over predicted 0.1ms mapping overhead
- Characterization tests (793 lines) provide strong data integrity safety net
- Regression risk is LOW once baseline is captured

---

## Required Actions Before Implementation

### P0 - BLOCKERS (Must Complete Before Slice 1)

#### 1. Create V4 Expectation Flow Analysis (4-6 hours)

**Path:** `docs/05_Reports/Refactor/v4_expectation_flow_analysis.md`

**Content Requirements:**
- Complete sequence diagram (Controller → Service → Repository → JPA)
- JPA entity usage table (entity | operation | frequency | async?)
- Async patterns documentation (Virtual Threads, ExecutorService)
- Cache strategies (TieredCache L1/L2, SingleFlight)
- Relationship documentation (EquipmentSnapshot, ProbabilityConvolver)

**Template:** Follow `v2_like_flow_analysis.md` structure (662 lines)

**Why Critical:**
- V4 handles 80%+ of `CharacterEquipment` usage
- V4 has complex async patterns that could break
- Performance optimization at risk (965 RPS, p99 214ms)

#### 2. Create Monitoring Query Guide (2-3 hours)

**Path:** `docs/05_Reports/Refactor/monitoring_query_guide.md`

**Content Requirements:**

```promql
# Prometheus Queries
# RPS (Requests Per Second)
rate(http_server_requests_seconds_count{uri="/api/v4/characters/*/expectation"}[5m])

# p50/p95/p99 Latency
histogram_quantile(0.50, rate(http_server_requests_seconds_bucket{uri="/api/v4/characters/*/expectation"}[5m]))
histogram_quantile(0.95, rate(http_server_requests_seconds_bucket{uri="/api/v4/characters/*/expectation"}[5m]))
histogram_quantile(0.99, rate(http_server_requests_seconds_bucket{uri="/api/v4/characters/*/expectation"}[5m]))

# Error Rate
rate(http_server_requests_seconds_count{status=~"5..",uri="/api/v4/characters/*/expectation"}[5m])

# Cache Hit Rates
sum(rate(cache_hit{layer="L1"}[5m])) / (sum(rate(cache_hit{layer="L1"}[5m])) + sum(rate(cache_miss[5m]))) * 100
sum(rate(cache_hit{layer="L2"}[5m])) / (sum(rate(cache_hit{layer="L2"}[5m])) + sum(rate(cache_miss[5m]))) * 100
```

```logql
# Loki Queries
{level="error", component="EquipmentExpectationServiceV4"} |= "error"
{component="TieredCache"} |= "MISS" or |= "HIT"
```

**Why Critical:**
- Cannot detect performance regressions without baseline
- Real-time monitoring required for production safety
- Quantitative validation needed for before/after comparison

#### 3. Capture Performance Baseline Data (1-2 hours)

**Commands:**

```bash
# 1. Run load test
wrk -t 4 -c 100 -d 30s -s load-test/wrk-v4-expectation.lua \
  http://localhost:8080/api/v4/characters/test/expectation \
  > results/wrk_baseline_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).txt

# 2. Run JMH benchmarks
./gradlew jmh | tee baseline_jmh.txt

# 3. Capture cache metrics from Prometheus
curl -s http://localhost:9090/api/v1/query?query=cache_hit_rate | jq .

# 4. Update baseline document
# Add RPS, p99, cache hit rates to BASELINE_20260210.md
```

**Why Critical:**
- Regression detection requires baseline
- Performance impact must be measured
- 5ms allowance needs validation

---

### P1 - HIGH Priority (Complete Before Slice 2)

#### 4. Create ADR Summary Document (3-4 hours)

**Path:** `docs/05_Reports/Refactor/ADR_Summary.md`

**Content Requirements:**
1. Shared Value Objects registry (CharacterId, UserIgn, Ocid)
2. Cross-slice dependency graph (4 slices with arrows)
3. Migration timeline (Week 1-4 Gantt chart)
4. Risk register (probability × impact)
5. Entity inventory (entity | slice | status)

**Why Critical:**
- Prevents duplicate VO definitions
- Coordinates multi-slice migration
- Identifies dependencies and risks

---

### P2 - MEDIUM Priority (Complete Before Verification)

#### 5. Codify ArchUnit Rules (2-3 hours)

**Path:** `src/test/java/maple/expectation/archunit/CleanArchitectureTest.java`

**Content:**

```java
@AnalyzeClasses(packages = "maple.expectation")
public class CleanArchitectureTest {

    @ArchTest
    static final ArchRule domain_must_not_depend_on_infrastructure =
        noClasses()
            .that().resideInAPackage("..domain.model..")
            .should().dependOnClassesThat()
            .resideInAnyPackage("..infrastructure..");

    @ArchTest
    static final ArchRule jpa_entities_must_be_in_infrastructure =
        classes()
            .that().haveNameMatching(".*JpaEntity")
            .should().resideInAPackage("..infrastructure..");

    @ArchTest
    static final ArchRule repositories_must_be_interfaces =
        classes()
            .that().resideInAPackage("..domain.repository..")
            .should().beInterfaces();
}
```

**CI/CD Integration:**
- Create `.github/workflows/archunit.yml`
- Fail build if rules violated

**Why Critical:**
- Enforces DIP compliance in CI/CD
- Prevents future architectural drift
- Automated verification

---

## Rollback Strategy

If Slice 1 fails:

1. **Immediate Rollback:** `git revert <commit-range>`
2. **Feature Toggle:** Use `maple.core.domain.enabled=false` if implemented
3. **Branch Isolation:** Work in `refactor/adr-017-slice1-equipment` branch
4. **Baseline Restoration:** Use baseline snapshot for metric comparison

**Rollback Triggers:**
- Test failures > 5%
- Performance degradation > 10% in RPS
- p99 latency increase > 20ms
- Any critical bug in production

---

## Council Consensus Statement

**We, the 5-Agent Council, unanimously agree:**

1. **The quality of completed work is exceptional** (8.9/10 overall score)
2. **The characterization test suite is exemplary** and serves as a model for future work
3. **The SOLID compliance analysis is rigorous** and the 9-commit migration plan is well-designed
4. **However, proceeding without V4 flow analysis would be negligent** - the risk is too high
5. **Performance baseline must be captured** before any refactoring begins
6. **Monitoring queries must be documented** to enable real-time regression detection

**Our recommendation:**

**Complete the missing analysis work (10-14 hours) before proceeding with Slice 1 implementation.**

This investment prevents weeks of potential rework and ensures the migration is successful on the first attempt.
