Current analysis reveals a **56% bloated module-app** (342 files) containing infrastructure concerns that violate clean architecture principles.

**Key Metrics:**
- Current state: 342 files in module-app (56% bloated)
- Goal: Clean architecture with SOLID principles
- Timeline: 4 phases over 10-14 days
- Investment: High short-term effort for long-term maintainability
- ROI: Reduced technical debt, improved testability, scale-out readiness

**Critical Findings:**
- ❌ 56 @Configuration classes in wrong module (P0)
- ✅ Zero circular dependencies maintained
- ✅ 94% stateless compliance achieved
- ✅ Module dependency direction: CORRECT ✓
- ⚠️ Test reliability: 62% → Target 95%

**Decision:** **APPROVED** to proceed with Phase 2 refactoring pending risk mitigation implementation.

## Current State Assessment

### What We Found (Data-Driven)

| Module | Current Files | Spring Annotations | Issues |
|--------|--------------|-------------------|--------|
| **module-app** | 342 | 228 | 56 @Configuration in wrong place |
| **module-infra** | 177 | 70 | Proper infrastructure placement |
| **module-core** | 59 | 0 | ✅ Framework-agnostic |
| **module-common** | 59 | 0 | ✅ Zero Spring dependencies |

### Key Architectural Violations

#### P0 - Critical Risks (Must Address)
1. **Configuration Leakage**: 56 @Configuration classes in module-app (should be in module-infra)
2. **Empty Package**: module-app/repository/ is completely empty
3. **Infrastructure in Application**: monitoring/ (45 files), aop/ (7 files) in wrong module

#### P1 - High Risks (Should Address)
1. **Direct Infrastructure Dependencies**: 30+ files bypassing DIP ports
2. **Monitoring Placement**: 45 monitoring files should be in module-infra or new module-observability
3. **Scheduler/Batch**: Infrastructure concerns in application layer

#### P2 - Medium Risks (Consider Addressing)
1. **Service Layer Bloat**: 146 service files (v2/v4/v5 mixed)
2. **Package Ownership**: Unclear boundaries for event/ and util/ packages
3. **Test Reliability**: 62% flaky test prevention score

### Strengths (Building On)

- ✅ **Zero circular dependencies** at module level
- ✅ **Clean dependency direction**: app → infra → core → common
- ✅ **Framework-agnostic core**: module-core has 0 Spring annotations
- ✅ **Strong stateless design**: 94% compliance with strategic in-memory state
- ✅ **Comprehensive rollback strategy**: 4 scenarios documented

## Proposed Solution: 4-Phase Refactoring

### Phase 1: module-common (1-1.5 days) ✓ **COMPLETE**

**Completed:**
- Moved error handling, utilities to common module
- Added verifyNoSpringDependency guard
- Result: 59 files, zero Spring dependencies
- Updated all import statements across project

**Verification Results:**
```bash
✓ module-common has zero Spring dependencies
✓ All compilation tests passing
✓ Import verification complete
✓ Test suite passing
```

### Phase 2: Core Domain + Ports (3-5 days) **PENDING**

**Objectives:**
- 2-A: Define Port interfaces for domain abstractions
- 2-B: Extract Calculator domain logic to core module
- 2-C: Implement DIP compliance across service layer

**Estimated Effort:** 40 hours
**Risk Level:** Medium (touches 30+ files)
**Success Metrics:**
- Zero direct infrastructure dependencies in services
- All services depend on module-core ports only
- Business logic completely isolated from infrastructure

### Phase 3: Infrastructure Move (3-4 days)

**Target Moves:**
- Move `config/` (56 @Configuration classes) to module-infra
- Move `monitoring/` (45 files) to module-infra/observability
- Move `aop/` (7 files) to module-infra/infrastructure/aop
- Move `scheduler/`, `batch/`, `alert/` to module-infra

**Impact:**
- module-app: 342 → ~200 files (-41%)
- module-infra: 177 → ~280 files (+58%)
- Application layer becomes pure orchestration

### Phase 4: Cleanup & Verification (1-2 days)

**Activities:**
- Remove empty packages
- Update documentation
- Final architecture verification
- Performance regression testing
- CI/CD pipeline integration

| module-core | 59 | < 80 | +36% capacity |
| module-common | 59 | < 75 | +27% capacity |

### Quality Metrics

| Metric | Current | Target | Status |

| Circular dependencies | 0 | 0 | ✅ Maintained |
| Spring annotations in module-core | 0 | 0 | ✅ Maintained |
| @Configuration in module-app | 56 | < 5 | ⚠️ P0 Risk |
| Direct infra dependencies in app | 30+ | 0 | ⚠️ P1 Risk |
| Test reliability score | 62% | 95% | ⚠️ P2 Risk |

### Architectural Compliance

| Principle | Current | Target |
|-----------|---------|--------|
| SRP (module-app) | ❌ Violated | ✅ Compliant |
| DIP direction | ✅ Correct | ✅ Maintained |
| Framework-agnostic core | ✅ Yes | ✅ Maintained |
| Module boundary violations | Unknown | 0 (measured by ArchUnit) |

## Risk Mitigation Strategy

### 1. Comprehensive Rollback Strategy (4 Scenarios)

**Rollback Triggers:**
- Mid-phase: Compilation/test failures → `git reset --hard pre-phase-N`
- Post-merge: Staging failures → Create revert PR
- Partial: Phase 3 fails → Keep Phase 1&2, rollback Phase 3 only
- Emergency: Production issues → Deployment rollback to last stable tag

**Verification Scripts:**
- `scripts/verify-rollback.sh` - Automated rollback verification
- `scripts/health-check.sh` - Post-rollback health validation
- Git tagging strategy with pre-phase markers

### 2. SOLID Verification Tests in CI/CD

**Test Coverage:**
- ArchTest.java (633 lines) - Core architectural rules
- SOLIDPrinciplesTest.java - 5 nested test classes
- ModuleDependencyTest.java - Dependency direction enforcement
- SpringIsolationTest.java - Framework-agnostic verification
- StatelessDesignTest.java - Scale-out readiness

**CI Integration:**
```yaml
# .github/workflows/ci.yml
- name: Run architecture tests
  run: ./gradlew test --tests "architecture.*"
```

### 3. Flaky Test Prevention (62% → 95% Target)

**Current Gaps:**
- ❌ No Clock abstraction (0% coverage)
- ⚠️ Thread.sleep() overuse (90 occurrences)
- ❌ Missing @DirtiesContext in chaos tests
- ⚠️ Partial test isolation

**Improvement Plan:**
1. Inject Clock bean into time-dependent services (+15%)
2. Add @DirtiesContext and explicit cleanup (+10%)
3. Replace Thread.sleep() with Awaitility (+8%)
4. Implement deterministic randomization (+2%)

### 4. Phase-by-Phase Execution

**Safety Measures:**
- Git tags before each phase (`pre-phase-2a`, `pre-phase-2b`, etc.)
- One package at a time movement
- Full test suite after each move
- Staging environment validation before develop merge
