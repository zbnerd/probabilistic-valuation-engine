## 📝 Detailed Script (Scenario A - Technical Deep Dive)

### Part 1: Hook (2 min)

**Slide 1: Title Slide**
```
probabilistic-valuation-engine: Enterprise-Grade Resilience on a Budget
"1 Request = 150 Standard Requests"

RPS 965 | p50 95ms | p99 214ms | 0% Failure
Single AWS t3.small (~$15/month)

Presenter: [Your Name]
Date: [Date]
```

**Script:**
> "Good morning everyone. Today I want to show you how to build enterprise-grade resilient systems that handle 1,000+ concurrent users on a single $15/month instance.
>
> The key insight? **'1 Request equals 150 Standard Requests'** when processing 200-300KB JSON payloads. We're not just optimizing for speed; we're optimizing for **cost efficiency** and **zero failure operations** under extreme constraints.
>
> Let me show you how we achieved RPS 965 with p50 under 100ms and 0% failure rate using Java 21 and Spring Boot 3.5."

**Visual Aids:**
- Live Grafana dashboard (pre-loaded)
- Architecture diagram (Mermaid or PNG)

### Part 2: Problem (3 min)

**Slide 2: The Challenge**
```
Problem: Extreme Payload Density

| Metric | Typical Web | probabilistic-valuation-engine | Ratio |
|--------|-------------|------------------|-------|
| Payload per Request | ~2KB | 200-300KB | 100-150x |
| Memory per 100 Users | ~10MB | 1.5GB | 150x |
| Serialization Cost | 1ms | 150ms | 150x |
```

**Script:**
> "The challenge isn't just throughput; it's **payload density**. Each MapleStory equipment calculation requires 200-300KB of JSON data—that's **100-150x larger** than typical web requests.
>
> This creates three cascading problems:
> 1. **Memory pressure**: 100 users consume 1.5GB RAM
> 2. **Serialization bottleneck**: 150ms just to parse JSON
> 3. **Cache stampede risk**: When cache expires, DB gets hammered
>
> Traditional solutions? Scale horizontally. But our constraint: **single t3.small, $15/month**. We had to think differently."

**Visual Aids:**
- Animated GIF showing memory usage spike during cache expiry
- Flame graph from profiler showing serialization hotspot

```

**Script:**
> "Our solution centers on **7 core modules** working in concert. Let me walk through the critical path:
>
> **1. Buffer & Cache (L1/L2):** We use Caffeine for L1 in-memory cache and Redis for L2 distributed cache. This absorbs 85% of requests without hitting the database.
>
> **2. Circuit Breaker:** When external API failure rate exceeds 50%, the circuit opens immediately. This prevents cascade failures.
>
> **3. Singleflight:** If 100 users request the same character data simultaneously, we make **exactly one API call** and broadcast the result. This reduces API load by 99%.
>
> **4. Outbox Pattern:** We never lose data. Every write goes to both the database and an outbox table. On failure, we replay asynchronously with 99.98% success rate.
>
> The key insight? These patterns work **together**, not in isolation. The Circuit Breaker protects the Singleflight. The Outbox enables the Cache-Aside strategy."

**Visual Aids:**
- Live architecture diagram with animated data flow
- Code snippet showing Singleflight pattern:
  ```java
  @SingleFlight(key = "character-{IGN}")
  public CharacterData fetch(String ign) {
      return apiClient.fetch(ign); // Called once per 100 concurrent users
  }
  ```

### Part 4: Evidence (5 min)

**Slide 4: Performance Numbers**
```
✅ RPS 965 (Requests Per Second)
✅ p50 95ms (Median Latency)
✅ p99 214ms (99th Percentile)
✅ 0% Failure (18 Nightmare Chaos Tests)
```

**Script:**
> "Let's look at the evidence. These aren't theoretical benchmarks; these are **production-grade results** validated by 18 Nightmare chaos tests.
>
> **Throughput:** We achieved 965 RPS on a single t3.small. That's **64 RPS per dollar** of infrastructure.
>
> **Latency:** p50 under 100ms means typical users get instant results. p99 at 214ms means even in worst-case scenarios, users wait less than a quarter-second.
>
> **Reliability:** Zero failure rate. Not '99.9%', not 'four nines'—**literally 0%** across 18 chaos scenarios including API outages, database crashes, and network partitions."

**Slide 5: Cost Efficiency**
```
Cost Performance Analysis (N23)

| Instance | Monthly | RPS | $/RPS | Efficiency |
|----------|--------|-----|-------|------------|
| t3.small | $15    | 965 | $0.016 | **Baseline** |
| t3.medium | $30    | 1,928 | $0.016 | +0.6% |
| t3.large | $45    | 2,989 | $0.015 | **Best (3.1x)** |
| t3.xlarge | $75    | 3,058 | $0.025 | -37% |
```

**Script:**
> "Cost matters. We systematically tested 4 instance sizes and found a **non-linear relationship**. t3.large delivers 3.1x throughput for only 3x cost, making it the **efficiency winner**.
>
> But t3.xlarge? Costs 5x more but only 3% additional throughput. **Diminishing returns** kick in hard.
>
> This data-driven approach to infrastructure sizing is what I mean by 'evidence-based operations.'"

### Part 5: Q&A Preparation (3+ min)

**Slide 6: Key Learnings**
```
Top 3 Learnings:

1️⃣ Resilience > Performance
   - Fast but broken = useless
   - Circuit Breaker > faster API calls

2️⃣ Evidence Over Opinions
   - Measure everything
   - 18 chaos tests > gut feelings

3️⃣ Constraints Drive Innovation
   - $15/month constraint → creative solutions
   - Single instance → stateless architecture
```

**Script:**
> "Before we open for questions, I want to share our top learnings:
>
> **First, resilience beats raw performance.** A fast-but-broken system is useless. The Circuit Breaker that makes us 'slower' in failure scenarios is what enables **zero failures** in success scenarios.
>
> **Second, evidence over opinions.** We didn't guess that t3.large was optimal—we tested it. 18 chaos scenarios, not 3. Load tests, not simulations.
>
> **Third, constraints drive innovation.** The $15/month budget forced us to eliminate waste. The single-instance constraint forced us to go stateless. Creativity thrives under constraints."

**Transition to Q&A:**
> "With that, I'd love to hear your questions. Whether about the technical implementation, the business model, or the chaos engineering methodology—ask away!"

## 🎤 Expected Q&A & Responses

### Question 1: "Why Java 21 instead of Go/Rust?"
**Context:** Tech stack choice
**Preparation Time:** 30s research before talk

**Response:**
> "Great question. We chose Java 21 for three reasons:
>
> **1. Virtual Threads:** Java 21's virtual threads gave us async-like performance without the complexity of reactive programming. We tested 10,000 concurrent virtual threads on a single core—no problem.
>
> **2. Team Familiarity:** We're a Spring Boot shop. Rewriting in Go/Rust would take months. Java 21 let us innovate **incrementally**.
>
> **3. Ecosystem Maturity:** Resilience4j, Caffeine, Redisson—these libraries are battle-tested. Rust's tokio ecosystem is excellent but younger.
>
> **Trade-off:** If we were starting from scratch? Maybe Go or Rust. But for an existing Java team? Java 21 was the **strategic choice**."

---

### Question 2: "How do you handle cache stampede?"
**Context:** Technical deep-dive on caching
**Preparation Time:** Review N23 cost report

**Response:**
> "Cache stampede is one of our highest-priority risks. Here's our **3-layer defense**:
>
> **Layer 1: Randomized Expiry** - We add jitter to cache TTLs. Instead of all expiring at 12:00:00, they expire between 12:00:00 and 12:05:00. This spreads the load.
>
> **Layer 2: Singleflight** - When 100 users request the same data, we make **one** API call and broadcast the result. This eliminates the thundering herd.
>
> **Layer 3: Request Coalescing** - If the cache is warming up, we queue requests and batch them. Users wait a bit longer, but the database doesn't melt.
>
> **Evidence:** In our N23 cost report, we tested intentional cache expiry. Database CPU spiked from 20% to 45% but **never hit 100%**. That's the proof it works."

---

### Question 3: "What's your incident response process?"
**Context:** SRE/DevOps focus
**Preparation Time:** Review N21 auto-mitigation report

**Response:**
> "We have a **3-tier response system**:
>
> **Tier 1: Automatic (0s)** - Circuit Breaker opens automatically when failure rate > 50%. MTTD (Mean Time To Detect) is **30 seconds**.
>
> **Tier 2: Auto-Mitigation (30s)** - If degradation persists, the system automatically reduces request rate. This buys us time to respond.
>
> **Tier 3: Manual (2m)** - On-call engineer investigates. MTTR (Mean Time To Resolve) is **2 minutes**.
>
> **Real Example:** In N21, p99 spiked from 3s to 21s. The Circuit Breaker opened in 30s, auto-mitigation kicked in at 1m, and we fully recovered in 4m—**without waking anyone up**.
>
> The key insight? **Automation beats on-call speed** every time."

---

### Question 4: "How do you measure ROI?"
**Context:** Business value justification
**Preparation Time:** Review BSC financial KPIs

**Response:**
> "We track **4 financial metrics**:
>
> **1. Cost per Request** - Currently $0.016 per request. Target: < $0.01 by optimizing JVM.
>
> **2. RPS per Dollar** - Currently 64 RPS/$. Competitors: ~10 RPS/$. We're **6.4x more efficient**.
>
> **3. Infrastructure Utilization** - Currently 65%. We're under-provisioned by design (headroom for spikes).
>
> **4. Total Cost of Ownership (TCO)** - $15/month infrastructure + ~$100/month development time (estimated). For a portfolio project, this is excellent.
>
> **For a commercial version?** We'd project $0.001 per calculation at 1M calculations/month = $1,000/month revenue. $50 infrastructure = **95% gross margin**."

---

### Question 5: "What didn't work?"
**Context:** Learning from failures
**Preparation Time:** Review ADRs for trade-offs

**Response:**
> "Oh, lots of things failed. Here are the **3 biggest mistakes**:
>
> **Mistake 1: Oversized Cache** - We initially allocated 8GB to Redis. Waste. Usage never exceeded 2GB. **Lesson:** Measure before you provision.
>
> **Mistake 2: Aggressive Timeouts** - We set API timeouts to 500ms. Too aggressive. 5% of legitimate requests failed. **Lesson:** p99 optimization ≠ average optimization.
>
> **Mistake 3: Manual Outbox Replay** - Our first replay script was manual. Operator error caused data corruption. **Lesson:** Automate everything in the hot path.
>
> These failures are **well-documented in our ADRs** because we believe failed experiments teach more than successful ones."
